The Parable of the Wedding Banquet by Mathew 
Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: 2 “The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.

Then he sent some more servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: 
My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet
But they paid no attention and went off—one to his field, another to his business
The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them
The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city

They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians.
“Teacher,” they said, “we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth
You aren’t swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are. 
Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay the imperial tax[a] to Caesar or not?
But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, “You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me? 
Show me the coin used for paying the tax.” They brought him a denarius,

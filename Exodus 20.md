The Ten Commandments by Moses. New International version Bible
You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name
Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you
You shall not murder
You shall not commit adultery
You shall not steal
You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor
You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife. 
I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery
Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold.
Make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and goats and your cattle
